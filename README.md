### What?

There are 10 types of programmers:  those who love to travel and those who do not!
But travelling to a new country is intimidating sometimes; the culture and the language is a behemoth task. Planetes comes to your help!
Planetes contains a basic phrasebook of  almost every language with the written script and the corresponding transliteration.

### Why planetes?

Planetes is Greek for wanderer. Ergo, someone who needs to use this a lot is a wanderer.
